This is a project based on Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System (User-Based) using Streamlit. It simplifies movie selection by recommending similar movies when a specific user id is searched, providing a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience. It recommends a list of the top 5 movies. Hope you enjoy it:)

### Instructions how to go about it:
1. **Run this code for installation of necessary libraries :** ```!pip install streamlit pickle```(if required) <br><br>
2. **Run the jupyter file 'User-Based Collaborative Filtering.ipynb' to get pickle files i.e `cosine_sim.pkl` , `merge_df.pkl` and `user_movie_matrix.pkl`**<br><br>
3. **Open Anaconda Prompt, enter the current directory of the folder using 'cd' command :** ```cd folder_path```.
   <br>**For Example:** ```cd C:\Users\Desktop\Github\User-based-Collaborative-Filtering-Movie-RS```<br><br> 
4. **Run this code to launch your streamlit app :** ```streamlit run app.py``` (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
