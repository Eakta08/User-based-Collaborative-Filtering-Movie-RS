This is a project based on Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System (User-Based) using Streamlit. It simplifies movie selection by recommending similar movies when a specific user id is searched, providing a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience. It recommends a list of the top 5 movies. Hope you enjoy it:)

To run the below code you need to install streamlit : pip install streamlit

Then run the below code in command prompt : streamlit run app.py (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
